## Event overview

This was the fifth edition of a series of satellite meetings within the Conference of Complex Systems, providing an opportunity to discuss recent advances in the study of contagion processes across different scientific domains with a main focus on data-driven modelling approaches.

The meeting series is fully interdisciplinary and brings together researchers from a broad range of disciplines such as physics, mathematics, biology, epidemiology, human and veterinary medicine, computer science, information technologies and social sciences.

Particular attention is devoted to the following (non-exhaustive) list of topics:

* Interacting strain dynamics
* Long-lived and persistent diseases
* Complex contagion
* Zoonotic spread
* Temporal transmission networks
* Human adaptation
* Multiple transmission routes/multiplex networks
