## Event overview

The European Conferences on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology (ECMTB) are the major scientific events in this field in Europe and one of the major events worldwide, attracting the participation not only of the European researchers, but also of researchers from all over the world.

This was the main event of the *year of mathematical biology* (YMB), set up by the European Mathematical Society (EMS) and ESMTB. For that reason, ECMTB 2018 was, for the first time, a joint ESMTB-EMS conference and was co-organised by SPM (Portuguese Mathematical Society).

The conference brought together researchers from around the world to present and learn about cutting-edge research at the interface between mathematics and the life sciences.
