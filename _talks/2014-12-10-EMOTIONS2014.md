## Event overview

EMOTIONS 2014 was the first international colloquium organised by the [Laboratory of Excellence ECOFECT - eco-evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases][http://oldecofect.universite-lyon.fr/home-313924.kjsp]{:target="_blank"} on modelling infectious diseases.

The main objective of EMOTIONS 2014 was to explore the epidemiological, ecological, molecular and evolutionary dimensions of infections (human, wildlife) with a special focus on the mathematical models and computational methods that may be important instruments for such investigations.

Of particular interest was understanding the role played by species interactions at the individual and population levels as well as by the environment, on the onset and transmission of infections. The mechanisms and dynamics of such interactions and how these affect spread of infection were discussed, as well as how pathogen evolution may be affected by within-host competition among different microbes.
