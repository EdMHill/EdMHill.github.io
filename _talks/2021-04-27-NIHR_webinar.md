The webinar was aimed at applied statisticians interested in becoming principal investigators on grants. There were sessions on funding opportunities available, personal experience of securing funding as an applied statistician and public involvement and patient benefit in statistician led research.

Myself and [Sophie Staniszewska][SS_link]{:target="_blank"} had the opportunity to present a framework for including public involvement in mathematical & health economic modelling.
