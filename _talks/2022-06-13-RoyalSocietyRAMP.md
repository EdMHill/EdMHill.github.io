## Event overview

An all-day event, held at [The Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org){:target="_blank"}, that brought together the wide community of modelling scientists involved in the COVID-19 pandemic response to recognise their contributions. The schedule had five main sessions.

Sessions 1 and 2 consisted of talks by early career researchers across modelling disciplines relevant to the pandemic response. Topics included epidemic modelling, work on air-flow and human behaviour.   

Session 3 had further contributions from early career researchers in the form of (pre-recorded) flash-talks and an accompanying poster session.

Session 4 was a policy-focused panel discussion exploring the lessons from the pandemic for how the scientific community can respond to future emergencies.

The fifth and final session was held in the evening, with a series of public talks from three invited speakers:

* Making sense of pandemic dynamics – [Professor Adam Kucharski](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/kucharski.adam){:target="_blank"} ([London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk){:target="_blank"})
* Environmental factors in virus transmission - [Professor Chris Budd OBE](https://people.bath.ac.uk/mascjb/){:target="_blank"} ([University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"})
* The path from science to policy – [Dr Louise Dyson](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/dyson/){:target="_blank"} ([University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"})

## Joint talk
Myself and [Emily Nixon](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/emily-j-nixon){:target="_blank"} presented a joint talk on our research modelling the epidemiological implications of staggering the return of students to Higher Education settings in the UK in January 2021.
