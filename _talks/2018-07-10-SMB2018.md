## Event overview

A conference on connections between mathematics and the medical and life sciences.

Of particular interest to researchers who use mathematical ideas and mathematical models in areas such as mathematical biology, biomechanics, computational biology, biophysics, systems biology and quantitative life and medical sciences.

Theme areas include:

* physiological and medical modelling including cancer, diabetes, wound healing, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, tissue engineering and cellular signalling;
* epidemiology including contact networks, stochastic models and incorporating data in real time;
* ecological modelling, especially where models and data are brought together to address practical problems.
