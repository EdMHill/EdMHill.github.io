## Event overview
The SMB meeting was held for the first time in Korea. The meeting featured plenary talks, minisymposia, contributed talks, posters, and special focus workshops in various fields of mathematical oncology, cardiovascular modeling, immunology, epidemiology, methods for biological systems, ecology, cell/developmental biology, and neuroscience.

## Talk content
My talk summarised a study from the [Farmer-led Epidemic and Endemic Disease-management (FEED) project](https://feed.warwick.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, exploring the role of heterogeneous farmer behaviour to inform epidemiological models of livestock vaccination.
