## Event overview

IDDconf 2018 was the second instalment of a meeting series focussing on innovative research in infectious disease dynamics.

The meeting seeks to be an opportunity for infectious disease modellers to share new ideas, in-progress research, and build an open and collaborative network of scientists.

Topics include any aspects of infectious disease dynamics: from methodological to applied modelling of emerging, epidemic and endemic infectious diseases, including epidemiology, phylodynamics, evolutionary biology and ecology.

IDDconf is organised by the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases][CMMID_link]{:target="_blank"} at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine][LSHTM_link]{:target="_blank"}.

## Joint talk
Myself and Elizabeth Buckingham-Jeffery had the opportunity to present a joint talk on our research modelling visceral leishmaniasis in rural Brazil.
