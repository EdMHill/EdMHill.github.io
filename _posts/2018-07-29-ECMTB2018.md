From 23rd-27th July 2018 I attended the [11th European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology (ECMTB)][ECMTB2018_web]{:target="_blank"} held at the [Faculdade de Ci&#234;ncias da Universidade de Lisboa (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon)][LisbonUni]{:target="_blank"}. Co-organised by the [European Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology (ESMTB)][ESMTB_link]{:target="_blank"}, this meeting was the main event of the *Year of Mathematical Biology 2018*.

The packed scientific programme comprised 36 Minisymposia, 307 contributed talks and 119 posters.

### SBIDER involvement

A number of students and staff were present from the [SBIDER group][SBIDERweb_link]{:target="_blank"}. [Professor David Rand][DR_link]{:target="_blank"} was a speaker at a minisymposium on *Multi-scale mathematical models in endocrinology*, while contributions amongst a contingent of seven PhD students from the [MathSys DTC][Mathsys_link]{:target="_blank"} included presenting posters and giving presentations within *Epidemiology* and *Immunology* contributed talk sessions (pictured below).

My own contribution was a talk within the *Epidemiology I* session titled, *Assessing intervention responses against H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in Bangladesh*.

### Minisymposia

Though the talks I attended earlier in the week were primarily part of the contributed track, there were two minisymposia I was present for during the final couple of days of the conference.

On the Thursday, the session *'&quot;How to design evolution-proof public health interventions?&quot;* was well-attended and included a talk by [David Kennedy (Penn State University)][DK_link]{:target="_blank"} addressing the question *&quot;Why does drug resistance readily evolve but vaccine resistance does not?&quot;*

The last day of the conference included a minisymposia organised by [Ka Yin Leung][KYL_link]{:target="_blank"} that posed the question *&quot;Assuming compartmental models in infectious disease dynamics. Does it hurt?&quot;*. The minisymposium lineup was as follows:
