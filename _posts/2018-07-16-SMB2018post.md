I recently attended the annual running of the [Society for Mathematical Biology][SMB_Web] conference, [SMB2018][SMB2018_Web]. This years edition was held at the [University of Sydney][SydneyUni] from 8th-12th July 2018.

It was a thoroughly enjoyable event and a valuable opportunity to interact with colleagues from the international mathematical biology community. I was pleased to have the opportunity to present a contributed talk, *Evidence for history-dependence of influenza pandemic emergence*, in the *Epidemiology: Part B* parallel session.

Here, I outline a few points from the series of plenary talks:

The epidemiology themed plenary talk was titled *Modelling immunity:a multi-scale problem*, delivered by  [Jane Heffernan][JaneH_link], director of the [Centre for Disease Modelling (CDM)][CDM_link] at [York University][YorkUni]. The multiple scales referred to in the talk title are how infectious diseases affect individuals (immunology) and populations (epidemiology). Mathematical models that link the in-host and populations scales of infection can better inform public health programs, although a drawback of immuno-epidemiological models are that they can rapidly become very complex. The talk discussed immunological, epidemiological and immuno-epidemiological modelling studies, applied to a breadth of infectious diseases including influenza, HIV, measles and pertussis.

[Jennifer Flegg][JennFlegg_link] ([University of Melbourne][MelbUni]) gave a nice overview of mathematical models developed for wound healing and the biological impact they have made. Jennifer's own research is aimed at informing clinical treatment of non-healing wounds be devising governing equations which capture the essential behaviour of the complex system.

Conservation had prominent presence throughout the conference, with [Hugh Possingham][HughP_link] presenting *How mathematics can be used in nature conservation*. Hugh is Chief Scientist at [The Nature Conservancy][NatureConv], an organisation addressing the most pressing conservation threats at the largest scale. The talk provided a variety of examples of how operations research and ecological modelling has formulated and solved pressing conservation problems - from locating places for national parks to saving threatened species. For its message and conciseness, I particularly liked the concluding slide from the plenary talk by Hugh, summarising the modelling cycle:

The final plenary of the conference was delivered by [Alex James][AlexJames_link] ([University of Cantebury][CantUni]). Walking through the history of foraging theory, I was unaware levy walks had dominated mathematical descriptions of foraging since the mid-1990s. She concluded by stating that although power laws are incredibly useful, they probably are not in the context of foraging.
