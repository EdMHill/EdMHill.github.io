From 3rd-5th September 2018 I attended [IDDconf 2018: A Conference on Infectious Disease Dynamics][IDDconf2018_web]{:target="_blank"} held at the [Ambleside Campus, University of Cumbria][CumbriaUni]{:target="_blank"}.

IDDconf 2018 was the second instalment of a new meeting series focussing on innovative research in infectious disease dynamics. Organised by the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases][CMMID_link]{:target="_blank"} at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine][LSHTM_link]{:target="_blank"}, IDDconf provides a fairly small (~100 participants), community-driven conference, to improve interaction between modellers.

### The scientific programme

The programme consisted of a single-stream of 44 short talks (12 mins in length & 3 mins for questions), with a small poster session during the evening reception on the opening day.

A novel aspect is those wishing to present a talk only need to submit a title, with talk selection done randomly. Myself and [Elizabeth Buckingham-Jeffery][EBJ_link]{:target="_blank"} had the opportunity to present a joint talk on our collaborative work 'Spatio-temporal modelling of visceral leishmaniasis among domestic dogs in rural Brazil'.

### Social programme
The second afternoon was allocated as free time, with many attendees spending the afternoon going on walks in the Lake District countryside.
