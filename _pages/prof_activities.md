## Awards and prizes

**2022** Weldon Memorial Prize.

* Awarded to the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (SPI-M-O) for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* The Weldon Memorial Prizes recognises noteworthy contributions to the development of mathematical or statistical methods applied to problems in Biology.
* The award recognises the epidemiological modelling conducted by SPI-M-O that supported the UKâ€™s policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**2022** SPI-M-O Award for Modelling and Data Support.

* Recognition of those who made an exceptional contribution, during the COVID-19 pandemic, to the work of SPI-M-O outside of their usual work activity.

## Editor and reviewer roles
I am an Editorial Board member for the [Journal of Theoretical Biology][JTB_link]{:target="_blank"}.

I was a guest editor of a Pandemics Special Issue of [Mathematics Today](https://ima.org.uk/publications/mathematics-today/){:target="_blank"}, the magazine of the [Institute of Mathematics and its Applications](https://ima.org.uk/about-us/){:target="_blank"}. The Special Issue was published in October 2022, with the Editorial available to view online [here](https://ima.org.uk/20322/pandemics-special-issue-editorial/){:target="_blank"}.

For an overview of my reviewing history, please visit my Peer Review record on [Web of Science][Publons_link]{:target="_blank"} and [ORCID][ORCID_link]{:target="_blank"}.
