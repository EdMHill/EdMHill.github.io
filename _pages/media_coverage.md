I have experience of interacting with outlets such as the [Science Media Centre](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org){:target="_blank"}. I have been a speaker at press briefings to present and discuss the following studies:

* ["An analysis of school absences in England during the COVID-19 pandemic"](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/new-preprint-on-schools-and-covid-19-spread/){:target="_blank"}

* ["SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK university students: lessons from September-December 2020 and modelling insights for future student return"](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/preprint-on-covid-19-and-universities/){:target="_blank"}

I have provided comments during the COVID-19 pandemic that have contributed to written media pieces, including on BBC news ([on school reopening in June 2020](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52933323){:target="_blank"}) and Reuters ([on the implications of COVID-19 on seasonal flu disease burden in Europe](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-europe-influenza-a/analysis-could-covid-knock-out-flu-in-europe-this-winter-idUKKBN28B538?edition-redirect=uk){:target="_blank"}).

My work has also featured in radio interviews with Free Radio and BBC Coventry and Warwickshire.

As well as research papers, I have written articles for media outlets and magazines:

* [When it comes to mental health, parents shouldn't worry who their children are friends with](https://theconversation.com/when-it-comes-to-mental-health-parents-shouldnt-worry-who-their-children-are-friends-with-46225){:target="_blank"} *The Conversation*

* [How predictable are flu pandemics?](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2017.01090.x){:target="_blank"} *Significance*
