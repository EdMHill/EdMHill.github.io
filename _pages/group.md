### Postgraduate

* [**Zak Ogi-Gittins**](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/people/students/mathsysii/gittins/){:target="_blank"} (PhD), October 2021 - present. Working on reproduction number inference methodologies and modelling of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in domestic poultry in the UK. Co-supervised by [Robin Thompson](https://www.robin-thompson.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}.
* [**Phoebe Asplin**](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/people/students/mathsysii/asplin/){:target="_blank"} (PhD), October 2022 - present. Working on modelling the impact of symptom severity on health economic outcomes. Co-supervised by [Matt Keeling](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/matt_keeling/){:target="_blank"}.
* [**Rachel Seibel**](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/people/students/mathsysii/seibel/){:target="_blank"} (PhD), October 2022 - present. Working on how human behaviour influences pathogen dynamics during disease outbreaks. Co-supervised by [Mike Tildesley](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/mtildesley/){:target="_blank"}.
* [**Elliot Vincent**](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/people/students/mathsysii/vincent/){:target="_blank"} (PhD), October 2023 - present. Working on spatial and epidemiological modelling for wildlife and agricultural health. Co-supervised by [Erin Gorisch](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/egorsich/), [Matt Keeling](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/matt_keeling/){:target="_blank"} and [Stephen Parnell](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/sparnell/).
* [**Reanna Gregory**](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/igpp/ab101/104/){:target="_blank"} (PhD), April 2024 - present. Working on assessing the risk levels posed by different potential pandemic influenza strains, bridging between lab-based virology work and mathematical epidemiology. The aim is to generate data that informs the modelling process and can support conclusions made in silico. Co-supervised by [Craig Thompson](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/med/research/biomedical/labs/cthompson/){:target="_blank"}.
* [**Fateen Yasir**](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/people/students/mathsysii/fateen_yasir){:target="_blank"} (PhD), August 2024 - present. Working on modelling, parameter inference and policy recommendations for measles. Co-supervised by [Matt Keeling](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/matt_keeling/){:target="_blank"}.
