We may impart research impact through conveying our scientific findings to the public in an accessible, understandable manner.

In May 2022, Myself and [Laura Guzmán Rincón](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiUl4elt4f4AhXPfMAKHVs_DG0QFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Flaura-guzman-rincon&usg=AOvVaw0ZPcY2JhxEcIGB7n98Sq2X){:target="_blank"} co-created the SBIDER Podcast Hub, supported by a [Royal Society Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP) Outreach Innovation Award](https://gateway.newton.ac.uk/news/2022-05-16/14342){:target="_blank"} (UKRI Grant EP/V053507/1). We are producing two podcast series:

* [SBIDER presents](https://sbiderpresents.podbean.com){:target="_blank"} - researchers from the [Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research group (SBIDER)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute){:target="_blank"}, based at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, share their research and we present recent group news;
* [SBIDER Careers Podcast](https://sbidercareerspodcast.podbean.com){:target="_blank"} - exploring the career trajectories of SBIDER researchers, their collaborators and those who carry out important work that enables and supports the research being conducted.

I am a member of the [Warwick Institute of Engagement](https://warwick.ac.uk/wie/aboutwie/){:target="_blank"} Network and have contributed to a University of Warwick family day, in which a collaborative group across SBIDER and Warwick Medical School ran a set of "have a go" activities under the theme of "Outbreak - Learning how diseases spread".

I have been a co-organiser of [Databeers Warwick](https://databeerswrik.tumblr.com){:target="_blank"}, a series of public engagement events around the topic of data science. These events brought together data experts from industry and academia with talks at a level accessible to a wide audience in the West Midlands.

For [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk){:target="_blank"}, a science festival which brings researchers to local venues to share their scientific discoveries with the public, at events in Coventry & Warwickshire I have made the following contributions:

* 2019: Event venue volunteer
* 2022: Presenter at the ["Our Amazing Body" event](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/our-amazing-body){:target="_blank"}. Delivered a talk titled "Disease detectives: how maths can help us against disease outbreaks".

Another method of communicating my research with the general public has been through `Behind the Paper' articles:

* [SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and possible future waves of infection](https://healthcommunity.nature.com/posts/sars-cov-2-variants-of-concern-and-possible-future-waves-of-infection-9d42ca1e-6f46-42c0-9aa5-606e732a2cfb){:target="_blank"}
* [Re-examining SARS-CoV-2 vaccine targeting and dose separation in England](https://healthcommunity.nature.com/posts/re-examining-sars-cov-2-vaccine-targeting-and-dose-separation-in-england){:target="_blank"}
