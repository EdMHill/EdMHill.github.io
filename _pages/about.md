Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Warwick][Warwick_link], working in the [School of Life Sciences][SLS_link] and [Mathematics Institute][WMI_link]. I am a member of the [Zeeman Institute: Systems Biology & Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research (SBIDER) group][SBIDER_link].

My research interests include the application of mathematical and computational methods in epidemiology, and analysis to determine the likelihood of spread of infectious diseases and social contagion.
