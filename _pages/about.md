Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Warwick][Warwick_link]{:target="_blank"}, working in the [School of Life Sciences][SLS_link]{:target="_blank"} and [Mathematics Institute][WMI_link]{:target="_blank"}. I am a member of the [Zeeman Institute: Systems Biology & Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research (SBIDER) group][SBIDER_link]{:target="_blank"}.

My research interests include the application of mathematical and computational methods in epidemiology, and analysis to determine the likelihood of spread of infectious diseases and social contagion.
