Hi! I am a Tenure Track Fellow in Health Protection Data Science at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}. I am affiliated to the [Institute of Population Health](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/#:~:text=Our%20institute,wellbeing%20through%20evidence%2Dbased%20insights.){:target="_blank"}, with ties to the [Civic Health Innovation Labs (CHIL)](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/civic-health-innovation-labs/about/){:target="_blank"} and [The Pandemic Institute](https://www.thepandemicinstitute.org){:target="_blank"}. I am involved in the following research groups within the University of Liverpool: [Statistical Modelling group](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/research/groups/statisticalmodelling/){:target="_blank"}; [Mathematical Biology](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematical-sciences/research/clusters/applied-mathematics/mathematical-biology/){:target="_blank"}.

I am a member of the [JUNIPER (Joint UNIversities Pandemic and Epidemiological Research)](https://maths.org/juniper/){:target="_blank"} Partnership. The JUNIPER Partnership is funded by [UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)](https://www.ukri.org){:target="_blank"}. JUNIPER is a collaborative network of researchers from across the UK who work at the interface between mathematical modelling, infectious disease control and health policy. I am also a Fellow of [Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests involve addressing interdisciplinary problems in epidemiology that involve the dynamics of behaviour. Application areas span public, veterinary and plant health policy, including zoonoses and the implementation of One Health approaches to disease management. My approach involves the application of mathematical and computational methods, including the development of models, parameter inference and the evaluation of interventions via computational simulation.

My research to date may be grouped under three broad categories: (i) Modelling to inform health policy; (ii) Social contagion and impact of behaviour on infectious disease dynamics; (iii) Zoonotic transmission and One Health.
