Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Warwick][Warwick_link]{:target="_blank"}, working in the [School of Life Sciences][SLS_link]{:target="_blank"} and [Mathematics Institute][WMI_link]{:target="_blank"}. I am a member of the [Zeeman Institute: Systems Biology & Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research (SBIDER) group][SBIDER_link]{:target="_blank"}.

I am also a member of [JUNIPER (Joint UNIversities Pandemic and Epidemiological Research)](https://maths.org/juniper/){:target="_blank"}, a consortium of epidemiological modelling groups from eight universities: Bristol, Cambridge, Exeter, Lancaster, LSHTM, Manchester, Oxford and Warwick. The JUNIPER consortium is funded by [UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)](https://www.ukri.org){:target="_blank"}. JUNIPER aims to embed scientific activities within an open and collaborative framework (including public outreach so that scientific assumptions and findings are effectively communicated), build national capacity and contribute to training the next generation of applied epidemiological modellers.

My research interests involve the application of mathematical and computational methods in epidemiology. In particular, parameter inference, outbreak prediction and development of interventions pertaining to infectious disease outbreaks and social contagion.

My research to date may be grouped under three broad categories: (i) Public health policy; (ii) Social contagion and impact of behaviour on infectious disease dynamics; (iii) Zoonotic transmission and One Health. See [Research]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/research.md %}){:target="_blank"} for more information on specific projects.
