## Talk content
My talk overviewed a modelling study originally conducted in late 2020 within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The work assessed the epidemiological impact of household bubble strategies over the Christmas period, which would allow extending contacts beyond the immediate household.

For more on this study, see the associated [paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2022.111331){:target="_blank"}.
