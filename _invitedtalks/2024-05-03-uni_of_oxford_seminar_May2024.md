## Talk content
My talk summarised two studies. The first overviewed a modelling study originally conducted in late 2020 within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The work assessed the epidemiological impact of household bubble strategies over the Christmas period, which would allow extending contacts beyond the immediate household. For more on this study, see the associated [paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2022.111331){:target="_blank"}.

The second was from the [Farmer-led Epidemic and Endemic Disease-management (FEED) project](https://feed.warwick.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, exploring the role of heterogeneous farmer behaviour to inform epidemiological models of livestock vaccination. For more on this study, please see the associated [publication in Preventive Veterinary Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.106019){:target="_blank"}.
