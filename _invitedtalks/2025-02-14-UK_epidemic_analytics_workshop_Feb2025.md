## Event overview
I was an invited speaker at this two-day UK epidemic analytics and modelling workshop. The workshop was organised by the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and [Epiverse](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/){:target="_blank"}. Held on 13 and 14 February 2025, the workshop brought together different UK teams working on, or likely to work on, modelling and analytics for new epidemic threats. 
 
The event had two main aims:

* Showcase current methods and/or tools among different groups, and identify areas for interoperability or collaboration in the event of a new pandemic
* Strengthen links between early career researchers in the network

## Talk content
