## Talk content
My talk summarised a recent study from the [Farmer-led Epidemic and Endemic Disease-management (FEED) project](https://feed.warwick.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, exploring the role of heterogeneous farmer behaviour to inform epidemiological models of livestock vaccination.

For more on this study, please see the associated [publication in Preventive Veterinary Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.106019){:target="_blank"}.
