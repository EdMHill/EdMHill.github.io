## Event overview
In March 2023, the [Newton Gateway to Mathematics](https://gateway.newton.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} celebrated its 10th anniversary. The Gateway is the impact initiative of the [Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.newton.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and reaches out to and engages with the users of mathematics â€“ in industry, business, public sector and other scientific disciplines. It helps to bridge the gap between those engaged in frontier mathematical research and those working in more applied areas, by stimulating the interchange of knowledge and ideas.

The Gateway has spent the past decade connecting mathematical research with industry, businesses, the public sector and other scientific disciplines.

On 14 November 2023, the 10th anniversary was celebrated with an afternoon of talks. Talks highlighted the breadth of Gateway activities and some of the key partnerships and successes. These covered examples of delivery of Open for Business events in support of INI Programmes, work through Innovate UK Analysis for Innovators Progarmme and a session where Early Career Researchers talked about their engagement opportunities through Gateway events and activities.

## Presentation recording
I was asked to speak about being a recipient of a RAMP Outreach Innovation Award and the subsequent establishment of the SBIDER Podcast Hub. This contributed to the session where Early Career Researchers talked about their engagement opportunities through Gateway events and activities.
