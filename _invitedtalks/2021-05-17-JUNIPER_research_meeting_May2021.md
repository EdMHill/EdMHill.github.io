## Event overview

[JUNIPER (Joint UNIversities Pandemic and Epidemiological Research)][JUNIPER_link]{:target="_blank"} is a [UKRI][UKRI_link]{:target="_blank"} funded consortium of epidemiology modelling groups from seven universities: Bristol, Cambridge, Exeter, Lancaster, Manchester, Oxford and Warwick. The teams of epidemiological modellers and statisticians in the JUNIPER consortium represent a core of committed and experienced research groups that have been generating predictions, forecasts and insights feeding into the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), both of whom advise the UK government on scientific matters relating to the UKâ€™s response to the pandemic.

This meeting was the second in a series of JUNIPER research meetings over the coming year. A key goal of the consortium is to be outward-facing and inclusive. These research meetings are a major part of the consortium's engagement with the wider epidemiological and mathematical research communities.

The talk outlined ongoing modelling work of the infectious disease dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants.
