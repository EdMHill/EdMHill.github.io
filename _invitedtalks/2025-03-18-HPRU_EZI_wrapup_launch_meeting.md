## Event overview
This event shared work from existing projects and future project plans for the [HPRU in emerging and zoonotic infections (HPRU-EZI)](http://hpruezi.nihr.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}. The HPRU-EZI is a partnership between the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM)](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and [UKHSA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency){:target="_blank"}, in collaboration with [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}. HPRU-EZI has been running since 2014, and supports and strengthens UKHSA in its role protecting England from emerging infections and zoonoses (i.e. those which spread from animals to humans). HPRU-EZI has played significant roles in the past in the UK response to Ebola, Zika, COVID-19 and mpox. The HPRU-EZI will continue to address the major emerging threats; these are transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks (e.g. dengue and Lyme), the respiratory route (e.g. COVID-19 and influenza), or directly through contact (e.g. Lassa fever).

The [National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Reserch Units (HPRUs)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/what-we-do/infrastructure/research-units/health-protection-research-units){:target="_blank"} undertake high quality research that enhances the ability of the [UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency){:target="_blank"} to protect the publicâ€™s health and minimise the health impact of emergencies. From 01 April 2025 there are 13 HPRUs across England. along with two NIHR Health Protection Research Focus Awards for emergency preparedness and response, and vaccines and immunisation.

I spoke incorporating behaviour into infectious disease models. What I presented was a personal view, highlighting studies that have caught my attention during the COVID-19 pandemic and the questions they pose.
