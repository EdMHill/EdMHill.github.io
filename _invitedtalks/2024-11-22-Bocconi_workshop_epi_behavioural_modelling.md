## Event overview
I was an invited speaker at this two-day workshop on Infectious Disease Modelling with Human Behaviour, held as part of the [IMMUNE project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101003183){:target="_blank"}. The IMMUNE project, led by [Prof. Alessia Melegaro](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/alessiamelegaro/){:target="_blank"} at [Bocconi University (Milan, Italy)](https://www.unibocconi.it/en){:target="_blank"}, aims to provide an interdisciplinary modelling framework that will explore the dynamics of human behaviour on infectionsâ€™ spread (with a particular focus on vaccination behaviour), through the lens of social sciences.

## Talk content
My talk summarised a recent study from the [Farmer-led Epidemic and Endemic Disease-management (FEED) project](https://feed.warwick.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, exploring the role of heterogeneous farmer behaviour to inform epidemiological models of livestock vaccination.

For more on this study, please see the associated [publication in Preventive Veterinary Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.106019){:target="_blank"}.
