## Event overview
The workshop focused on emerging challenges in mathematical epidemiology. While many of those challenges have been brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the aim and the scope of the workshop went beyond the pandemic. The workshop also acted to serve as an opportunity to re-evaluate the state of the art and the fundamentals of the discipline.
