## Event overview
The workshop focused on emerging challenges in mathematical epidemiology. While many of those challenges have been brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the aim and the scope of the workshop went beyond the pandemic. The workshop also acted to serve as an opportunity to re-evaluate the state of the art and the fundamentals of the discipline.

## Talk content
I spoke about incorporating behaviour into epidemiological models. What I presented was a personal view, highlighting studies that have caught my attention during the past couple of years and the questions they pose.
