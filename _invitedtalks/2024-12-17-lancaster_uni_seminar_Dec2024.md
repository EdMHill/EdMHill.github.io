## Talk content
This talk summarised two studies related to symptom propagation. The first was a scoping review on symptom propagation in respiratory pathogens of public health concern. For more on this study, see the associated [publication in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2024.0009){:target="_blank"}.

The second was a mathematical modelling focused study exploring the epidemiological and health economic implications of symptom propagation in respiratory pathogens. For more on this study, see the associated [publication in PLOS Computational Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012096){:target="_blank"}.

Details of this project may also be found on my research project webpage on [Investigating the impact of symptom propagation on epidemiological and health economic outcomes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _activeresearch/symptom_propagation.md %}){:target="_blank"}.
