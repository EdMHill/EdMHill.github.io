## Event overview

[JUNIPER (Joint UNIversities Pandemic and Epidemiological Research)][JUNIPER_link]{:target="_blank"} is a [UKRI][UKRI_link]{:target="_blank"} funded consortium of epidemiology modelling groups from seven universities: Bristol, Cambridge, Exeter, Lancaster, Manchester, Oxford and Warwick. The consortium was formed in the autumn of 2020 to provide quantitative epidemiological advice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This was an annual meeting, providing an opportunity for JUNIPER consortium members to hear about recent work and discuss future directions of research.

## Talk content
My talk summarised a recent study from the [Farmer-led Epidemic and Endemic Disease-management (FEED) project](https://feed.warwick.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, exploring the role of heterogeneous farmer behaviour to inform epidemiological models of livestock vaccination.

For more on this study, see the associated [preprint](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2547595/v1){:target="_blank"}.
